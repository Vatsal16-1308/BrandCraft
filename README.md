**BizForge** is a scalable, GenAI-native platform designed to democratize professional branding and business intelligence. By leveraging large language models (LLaMA-3) and state-of-the-art image generation (SDXL), it automates high-value creative and analytical workflows for enterprises and SMEs.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

BizForge follows a modern **Microservices-ready** architecture, decoupling the AI inference layer from the business logic handling.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Generative AI Core
- **Advanced NLP Engine**: Utilizes LLaMA-3.3-70b for context-aware content generation, delivering human-parity marketing copy and strategic insights.
- **Visual Synthesis**: Integrates Stability AI SDXL for vector-grade logo generation and visual asset creation.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time NLP processing of customer feedback to derive actionable business intelligence.

### 💼 Business Value
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on FastAPI for high-performance, asynchronous request handling suitable for high-concurrency environments.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements Google OAuth 2.0 and JWT standards for enterprise-grade security.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides real-time analytics on brand performance and customer sentiment.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.10+, FastAPI | High-performance, async support, native Pydantic integration for data validation. |
| **Frontend** | Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3 | Lightweight, zero-dependency client optimized for speed and compatibility. |
| **AI Ops** | Groq Cloud, Stability AI | Best-in-class inference speeds (Groq) and image quality (SDXL). |
| **Auth** | OAuth 2.0 (Google) | Industry-standard secure delegation protocol. |
